## hyo's reworked FRLG-styled RSE overworld sprites

This set is based on Poffin_Case's sprites, but edited, reformatted, and indexed by hyo.

If used, please give credit to both: hyo and Poffin_Case!

- Brendan, May, Wally, Scott, and a few other sprites were entirely re-sprited from scratch by me.
	- Brendan and May folders include new Pokenav/Region map icons that match the ones from FRLG. Make sure to place them in the correct directory of your repo.
	- Brendan and May (Both the Emerald and RS versions) also include .pal files. All other NPC's use the vanilla RSE palettes.
- A handful of the sprites were reworked or edited to better match the styles and proportions of FRLG, using Poffin Case's sprites as a base.
- The rest were left mostly unedited, just properly formatted and indexed with vanilla RSE palettes for drag/drop insertion.
