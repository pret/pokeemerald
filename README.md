This branch adds music from NDS Pokémon games to the Pokeemerald decompilations. It is recommended that your repository is up to date as long as this branch is too. Feel free to use the voice groups to make your own music. (Soundfonts available in the voicegroups folder!)

This branch also implements Ipatix's HQ m4a mixer and *15 voice direct sound polyphony*.
