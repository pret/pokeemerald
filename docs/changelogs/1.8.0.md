## 🌋 *IMPORTANT CHANGES* 🌋
* ***Python is now a required for the Expansion***.
    * Run the `command -v python3` command to see if you have it. If you don't, please check INSTALL.md to see how to install it.
* **Support for PoryMap v5.1.1 and lower has been dropped.**
    * [Please update your PoryMap version](https://github.com/huderlem/porymap/releases).
    * Specifically, we have removed the commented-out `gMonIconTable` table used to associate species IDs with icon images by @Bassoonian in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3896
        * From PoryMap v5.2.0 onwards, these icons are autodetected based on file/directory names instead.
    * To continue using older versions of PoryMap, you may restore the commented-out table, though you'll need to keep it up to date with any new items you add.
* **Backwards-compatible `BoxPokemon` Refactor** by @mrgriffin in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3438
    * HP and Status is now kept when depositing Pokémon in the PC
        * Previous behavior can be restored by setting `OW_PC_HEAL`.
    * Nature Mints are now fully functional.
        * Nature colors in summary screen are based on the changed nature by @Bassoonian in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3898

        * Cannot be seen in summary screen.
        * Dynamax Candy effect added.
        * Gigantamax Factor prevents Duraludon from evolving, like Pikachu, Eevee and Meowth beforehand.
        * Added `hasgigantamaxfactor` and `togglegigantamaxfactor` overworld script commands.
            * Gigantamax Factor cannot be toggled for Mythical Pokémon (vanilla behavior).
    * Hyper Training is now fully supported.
        * Cannot be seen in summary screen.
        * Added `canhypertrain` and `hypertrain` overworld script commands.
    * Shininess can be toggled with `MON_DATA_IS_SHINY`.
    * Added Tera Type field is added for future-proofing.
        * It can be seen in the summary screen by turning `P_SHOW_TERA_TYPE` on.
    * Added `isShadow` field for future-proofing.

    * Cleanup by
        * @fdeblasio in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3832
        * @AsparagusEduardo in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4017

* **Move Refactors**:
    * ***Move data unification*** by @LOuroboros, with help from @Bassoonian, @cfmnephrite and @AsparagusEduardo in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3999
        * Renamed `gBattleMoves` to `gMovesInfo`.
        * Moved move names to `gMovesInfo`.
            * Added `GetMoveName` to get all move names, removing the need for `GetMaxMoveName` and `GetZMoveName`.
        * Moved move descriptions to `gMovesInfo`.
        * Moved contest data to `gMovesInfo`.
    * ***Secondary/primary effects overhaul*** by @cfmnephrite in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3577
        * Secondary effects such as stat stage modifiers and status via are now set via `additionalEffects` field.
        * Eg.
            ```c
            [MOVE_THUNDER_FANG] =
            {
                .effect = EFFECT_FLINCH_STATUS,
                .secondaryEffectChance = 10,
                .argument = STATUS1_PARALYSIS,
                ...
            },
            ```
            Now becomes:
            ```c
            [MOVE_THUNDER_FANG] =
            {
                .effect = EFFECT_HIT,
                .additionalEffects = ADDITIONAL_EFFECTS(
                    { .moveEffect = MOVE_EFFECT_PARALYSIS, .chance = 10, },
                    { .moveEffect = MOVE_EFFECT_FLINCH,    .chance = 10, }
                ),
                ...
            },
            ```
            With customizable independent chances for each effect. Because of this, `secondaryEffectChance` has been removed.
        * For more info, check the wiki article on [How to add a new move](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/wiki/How-to-add-a-new-move-(Version-1.8.0-and-higher)).

            * By @AlexOn1ine in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4277
    * ***Renamed Battle Move "Split" to the proper "Category" term*** by @AsparagusEduardo in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3774
        ```diff
        -.split = SPLIT_PHYSICAL,
        +.category = DAMAGE_CATEGORY_PHYSICAL,
        ```
    * Z-move power override (eg. Mega Drain) was moved from a switch in `GetZMovePower` to move data. It's part of an union alongsize with Z-move status effect by @cfmnephrite in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3575
        * Cleanup by @AsparagusEduardo in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4201
    * Removed `EFFECT_RECOIL_x` effects in favor of new `recoil` field by @cfmnephrite in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3575
    * Removed critical-hit move effects in favor of new `criticalHitStage` by @cfmnephrite in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3779
        * Added `alwaysCriticalHit` move flag.
    * Converted `EFFECT_x` defines to an enum by @cfmnephrite in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3975
    * Move data now uses ternaries for data that was changed only once across generations by @AsparagusEduardo in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3987
        ```diff
        [MOVE_SWORDS_DANCE] =

            .accuracy = 0,
        +   .pp = B_UPDATED_MOVE_DATA >= GEN_6 ? 20 : 30,
        ```
    * Moved effect script array to `src/data/battle_move_effects.h` by @cfmnephrite in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3994
        * AI's `sEncouragedEncoreEffects` and Battle TV's `sPoints_MoveEffect` are now handled in this struct.
        * Some move flags were moved to this array instead
            * Semi-invulnerable flag (`semiInvulnerableEffect`) in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4062
                * Cleanup by @cfmnephrite in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4150
            * Flag to define Two-turn effects (`twoTurnEffect`) in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4062
            * Flag for increasing the protection counter (`usesProtectCounter`) in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4062
    * Removed `sheerForceBoost` in favor of checking their actual secondary effects by @cfmnephrite in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4096
        * To force Sheer Boost acting for a move without secondary effect, you can add `SHEER_FORCE_HACK` in the `additionalEffects` field.
* ***Learnset refactors***
    * ***Level up learnsets can now be switched by generational config*** by @MartyKen in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4049
        * Adds a file for each generation with data for all species.
            * Gen 1: Yellow
            * Gen 2: Crystal
            * Gen 3: RSE
            * Gen 4: HGSS
            * Gen 5: B2W2
            * Gen 6: ORAS
            * Gen 7: USUM
            * Gen 8:
                * Species from Gens 1-4: BDSP
                * Species from Legends: Arceus: Use that game's data.
                * Species from Gens 5-8: SwSh if they exist there. Otherwise, default to Gen 7's data.
            * Gen 9:
                * If they exist in SV, use that game's data.
                * Otherwise, default to Gen 8's data.
        * If a Pokémon doesn't exist in the respective generation, it uses the first instance it appears in.
            * Eg. Chikorita uses its Gen 2 learnset if the config is set to Gen 1.
            * ***IMPORTANT:*** Since the expansion's default had most movesets correspond to USUM's, conflicts will arise in `data/pokemon/level_up_learnsets/gen_7.h` if you modified the level learnsets. Be sure to backup your `data/pokemon/level_up_learnsets.h` before merging and then do the following after merging to keep your changes:

        * Cleanup by
            * @MartyKen in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4267
            * @AsparagusEduardo in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4275
    * Added `sUniversalMoves`, a near-universal teachable move array by @Bassoonian in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4052
        * This removes the need to add moves such as Hidden Power to almost every species.
        * Adds `tmIlliterate` flag that controls when specific species cannot learn these moves, such as Magikarp, Caterpie and Ditto.
    * ***Auto-generate teachable learnset data from JSON data*** by @Bassoonian in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3856
        - Scans the repository for TMs and tutor moves.
        - Checks JSON files (same format as PoryMoves, with minor label adjustments for an easier time) for compatibility.
        - Creates a `teachable_learnsets.h` file with the smallest size possible by only including the moves found in the scan.
        - Users can easily delete/add JSON files to reference less/more data as they see fit.
            - Eg. they can remove hgss.json to remove those games' compatibility list from being considered.
        - Any changes in `teachable_learnsets.h` made before this tool runs for the first time will be saved in `custom.json` for flawless migration.
        * Updated `teachable_learnsets.h` using this script by @Bassoonian in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4064
            * Further updated with new Indigo Disk data compatibility by @AsparagusEduardo in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4155
        * Can be disabled via `P_LEARNSET_HELPER_TEACHABLE`.
    * Removed previously untutorable moves from Mew's unteachable moves by @fdeblasio in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4142

* **Ability Refactor: new struct called `Ability` that stores both name and description of abilities** by @Bassoonian in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3861
    * AI ability scores moved to this struct by @Bassoonian in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3862
    * Added ability flags to replace arrays and switch statements by @cfmnephrite in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3886
        * `cantBeCopied`: Cannot be copied by Role Play or Doodle.
        * `cantBeSwapped`: Cannot be swapped with Skill Swap or Wandering Spirit.
        * `cantBeTraced`: Cannot be copied by Trace.
        * `cantBeSuppressed`: Cannot be negated by Gastro Acid or Neutralizing Gas.
        * `cantBeOverwritten`: Cannot be overwritten by Entrainment, Worry Seed or Simple Beam. Mummy/Lingering Aroma checks for `cantBeSuppressed` instead.
        * `breakable`: Can be bypassed by Mold Breaker-like abilities.
        * `failsOnImposter`: Currently unused.
        * Cleanup by @cfmnephrite in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3889

* **Type info consolidation by @fdeblasio in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4185**
    * New struct called `TypeInfo` that stores:
        * Name
        * Generic move name
        * Icon Palette index number
        * Type Z-Move
        * Type Max Move
        * Commented out data to assist users that desire to use it in their own hacks and as a reference for them to add items of new types.
            * Type-enhancing item (eg. Charcoal)
            * Type-resist berry
            * Type Gems
            * Z-Crystal
            * Tera Shard
            * Arceus form
    * Cleanup by @AsparagusEduardo in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4276

    * `ITEMS_COUNT` and `ITEM_NAME_LENGTH` by @Ninjdai1 in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3988
* IWRAM and EWRAM variables can now be assigned at boot by using `EWRAM_INIT` and `IWRAM_INIT` by @aronson in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3892
    * For example:
        ```c
        EWRAM_INIT u32 gFoo = 1337;
        IWRAM_INIT u32 gFastFoo = 31337;
        ```
    * Cleanup by @aronson in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3903
* Level Caps by @AlexOn1ine, @SBird1337 and PokemonCrazy in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3632
    * Types of caps (set in `B_EXP_CAP_TYPE`):
        * None (`EXP_CAP_NONE`): Regular behavior, no level caps are applied.
        * Hard (`EXP_CAP_HARD`): Pokémon with a level equal or above cap cap cannot gain any experience.
        * Soft (`EXP_CAP_SOFT`): Pokémon with a level equal or above cap will gain reduced experience.
    * Cap level can be set using either:
        * `LEVEL_CAP_FLAG_LIST`: Level cap is chosen according to the first unset flag in `sLevelCapFlagMap`.
        * `LEVEL_CAP_VARIABLE`: Uses a defined variable to dynamically change level cap.
    * Additional options include:
        * `B_RARE_CANDY_CAP`: If set to true, Rare Candies can't be used to go over the level cap.
        * `B_LEVEL_CAP_EXP_UP`: If set to true, mons under level cap will receive more experience.
    * Cleanup by @AsparagusEduardo in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4275
* Added new metaprogram macros by @cfmnephrite in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3968
    * Allows to set up default data without explicitily defining it.
        * Eg. setting Poké Balls as the default ball for all trainer classes.
* Elite Four/Champion transitions can now easily be applied to any trainer in their data by @fdeblasio in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4000
    * Based off @ShinyDragonHunter's [BetterMugshots](https://github.com/ShinyDragonHunter/pokeemerald/tree/BetterMugshots) branch.
    * To use, use these in `src/data/trainers.h`:
        * Use`mugshotEnabled` to enable it for the specific trainer.
        * Use `mugshotColor` to choose the color of the background for the transition between the following:
            * `MUGSHOT_COLOR_PURPLE`
            * `MUGSHOT_COLOR_GREEN`
            * `MUGSHOT_COLOR_PINK`
            * `MUGSHOT_COLOR_BLUE`
            * `MUGSHOT_COLOR_YELLOW`
    * Cleanup using metaprogram by @fdeblasio in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4140
* Added `OW_DOUBLE_APPROACH_WITH_ONE_MON` config to allow being spotted by two trainers with one mon in party for a 2v1 battle by @Bassoonian in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4007
* Added configs to enable metric system units by @pkmnsnfrn in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4183
    * Toggled by `UNITS` in `include/config.h`.
    * Cleanup by @pkmnsnfrn in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4193
* ***Implemented custom GiveMon scripting command*** by @LOuroboros, with help from @ghoulslash and @mrgriffin in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3924
    * Based off @ghoulslash's [custom_givemon](https://github.com/ghoulslash/pokeemerald/tree/custom_givemon) branch.
    * In addition to Species, Level and Held Item, users can now specify:
        * Poké Ball
        * Nature
        * Ability number
            * You can pass `NUM_ABILITY_PERSONALITY` to generate the ability based on personality by @LOuroboros in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4192
        * Gender
        * EVs
        * IVs
        * Moves
        * Shininess

        * Tera Type
* Save-compatible SaveBlock3, with 1624 bytes by @mrgriffin in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4112
    * ***IMPORTANT:*** This is incompatible with the "[Extra save space with two lines of code](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Extra-save-space-with-two-lines-of-code)" tutorial, which allocates that additional space to `SaveBlock1`, `SaveBlock2`, and `PokemonStorage` instead. To preserve save compatibility, change `SAVE_BLOCK_3_CHUNK_SIZE` to 0 and keep `SECTOR_DATA_SIZE` as 4084.
* Trainer Control
    * Trainer data encapsulation by @AsparagusEduardo in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4216
    * Added options for `TrainerMon`:
        * By @mrgriffin in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3438
            * Dynamax Level (`dynamaxLevel`)
            * Gigantamax Factor (`gigantamaxFactor`)
        * By @Nopinou in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4169
            * AI flags to signal when to Dynamax (`shouldDynamax`)
            * AI flags to signal when to Terastalize (`shouldTerastal`)
    * Sets neutral nature and ability to 0 as default by @AlexOn1ine in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4172
* Added `randompercentage` and `randomelement` script commands by @mrgriffin in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/4189
    * Allows to do the following:
        ```
        @ VAR_RESULT is one of Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip
        randomelement SPECIES_TREECKO, SPECIES_TORCHIC, SPECIES_MUDKIP
        @ Gives a random one of Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip.
        givemon VAR_RESULT, 5
        ```
        ```
        @ VAR_RESULT is TRUE 25% of the time, and FALSE 75% of the time.
        randompercentage 25
        @ Gives a Wobbuffet that is shiny 25% of the time.
        givemon SPECIES_WOBBUFFET, 20, isShiny=VAR_RESULT

* ***Berry Expansion*** by @Bassoonian in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3618
    * Berry Mutations (from XY): Planting a Berry tree next to another has a `BERRY_MUTATION_CHANCE` (25% by default) chance of causing a mutation (as dictated by `sBerryMutations`). Mutations mean that besides the usual output, the Berry plant will have a single Berry of the mutation (e.g. planting a Iapapa Berry next to a Mago Berry will cause it to have a single Pomeg Berry on top of its usual output).
        * Enabled via `OW_BERRY_MUTATIONS` config.
    * Easier Berry Debugging: Add berry manipulation functions to the debug menu to allow for forced growth and more.
    * Mulch (from Gen IV and XY): Using it on soil affects the growth, watering and production values of the plants.
        * Enabled via `OW_BERRY_MULCH_USAGE` config.
    * Gradient watering (from Gen IV and XY) (`OW_BERRY_MOISTURE` and `OW_BERRY_ALWAYS_WATERABLE`): rather than keeping track of if each stage has been watered like Gen III, the humidity of the soil is kept track of separately.
        * Enabled via `OW_BERRY_MOISTURE` config.
        * Switch between Gen4/6 via `OW_BERRY_ALWAYS_WATERABLE` config.
        * Rate of drying set by `OW_BERRY_DRAIN_RATE` config.
    * Weeding from XY: Berries may require unweeding for additional produce.
        * Enabled via `OW_BERRY_WEEDS` config.
    * Pests (from XY): Bug-type Pokémon may appear to feast on your plants.
        * Enabled via `OW_BERRY_PESTS` config.
    * Customisable stages: XY has six stages rather than four, so with this easy toggle you can choose the amount of stages without influencing the growth time.
        * Enabled via `OW_BERRY_SIX_STAGES` config.
    * Growth configs: Pick a generation whose Berry growth rates to use
        * Changed via `OW_BERRY_GROWTH_RATE` config.
    * Yield configs: Pick a generation whose Berry yields to use
        * Changed via `OW_BERRY_YIELD_RATE` config.
    * Cleanup by
        * @Bassoonian in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3931

        - If there's no space for the full amount of Premier Balls that would've been given, give the partial amount.

* Item Balls now can be defined in the map's JSON (or using PoryMap) via the common script `Common_EventScript_FindItem` instead of needing to define a new script for it by @pkmnsnfrn in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3942
    ```diff
      "trainer_type": "TRAINER_TYPE_NONE",
    - "trainer_sight_or_berry_tree_id": "0",
    - "script": "AbandonedShip_CaptainsOffice_EventScript_ItemStorageKey",

      "flag": "FLAG_ITEM_ABANDONED_SHIP_CAPTAINS_OFFICE_STORAGE_KEY"
    ```

        "script": "Common_EventScript_FindItem",
        "flag": "FLAG_ITEM_AQUA_HIDEOUT_B1F_NUGGET"
