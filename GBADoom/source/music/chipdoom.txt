Misc. Author Info       : Part of the Doomworld staff
			  (http://www.doomworld.com)

Description             : All the original Doom tunes remixed into
			  chiptunes via Impulse Tracker (IT) format. If you
			  don't know what a chiptune is, basically it
			  emulates the sound of the NES, Commodore64, etc.
			  music engines in the form of tracker-based music
			  (MOD, XM, S3M, IT, etc). It should be noted that
			  these songs were converted BY HAND, without the
			  aid of a MID->IT converter of any sort. In
			  general, the drums are not the same quality as in
			  most chiptunes, but better.
			  Version 1.1 tweaks the tempo of several songs to
			  get their lengths closer to the original MIDIs.
			  Also, E2M2 has a missing instrument added, and
			  there are various other improvements to some
			  other songs. The WAD is now compressed with 
			  WadPTR to save some space (20%).

Additional Credits to   : Tyler Pantella (picklehammer), whose MOD classes
			  were my inspiration:

			  Jeremy Elder (SgtCrispy), gave me pre-publishing
			  listening and encouragement:

			  Tom White (Hyena), who gave the first release of
			  this WAD praise in Doomworld's /newstuff 
			  Chronicles.

* Construction *

Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              : Version 1.0, several months
			  Version 1.1, a few days
Editor(s) used          : ModPlug Tracker and MIDI Orchestrator Plus! for
			  music, WinTex and XWE for inspecting and
			  inserting into WAD files, WadPTR for compressing
			  the WAD to save some space.
Known Bugs              : The various module players in various source
			  ports don't support crisp interpolation of the
			  music, so the songs may sound a little cracky at
			  times. If you want a fuller listening experience,
			  save the music lumps to IT files, or look under
			  "Web sites" at the end of this document to find
			  them in their native IT format. The songs sound
			  best in Winamp.
May Not Run With...     : doom.exe, any source port that doesn't support
			  tracker-format music (check your docs for MOD, 
			  module, or tracker support). Not sure if any
			  ports beside ZDoom support this.
