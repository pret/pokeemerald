@ NOTE: This defeat text actually causes a buffer overflow. It's about 50 bytes too long for
@ the gDisplayedStringBattle buffer that it's put into, and it stomps all over the gBattleTextBuffs
@ after, as well as the otherwise unused array after that. One wonders if that's the reason for
@ the existence of that unused array of ints.
